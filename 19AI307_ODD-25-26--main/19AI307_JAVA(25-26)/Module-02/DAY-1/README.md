# Ex.No:2(A) CLASS AND OBJECT

## QUESTION:
Create a class Vehicle with attributes as number, type and owner.

## AIM:
To Create a class Vehicle with attributes as number, type and owner.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3.	Import the package java.util.Scanner to read user input.
4.	Create a class Vehicle with data members: (number, type, owner).
5.	In the main() method, create a Scanner object.
6.	Create two objects of the Vehicle class.
7.	Read the details (number, type, owner) for both objects from user input.
8.	Display the details of both vehicles.

import java.util.Scanner;
class Vehicle{
    String number;
    String type;
    String owner;
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
        v1.number = sc.next();
        v1.type = sc.next();
        v1.owner = sc.next();

        Vehicle v2 = new Vehicle();
        v2.number = sc.next();
        v2.type = sc.next();
        v2.owner = sc.next();

        System.out.println(v1.number + " | " + v1.type + " | " + v1.owner);
        System.out.println(v2.number + " | " + v2.type + " | " + v2.owner);

        sc.close();
