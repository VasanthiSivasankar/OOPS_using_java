# Ex.No:3(C) ABSTRACTION

## QUESTION:
Create abstract class GameScore with method finalScore().  
Subclasses:
ArcadeGame: score = baseScore + (level × 100)
PuzzleGame: score = (attempts ≤ 3) ? 1000 - (attempts × 100) : 500 

## AIM:
To write a Java program that uses an abstract class to calculate final game scores for two types of games:  
ArcadeGame and PuzzleGame, each implementing its own scoring logic.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Create an abstract class `GameScore` with the abstract method `finalScore()`.
2. Create subclass `ArcadeGame` with:
   - Attributes: `base`, `level`
   - Scoring rule: `finalScore = base + (level × 100)`
3. Create subclass `PuzzleGame` with:
   - Attribute: `attempts`
   - Scoring rule:
     - If attempts ≤ 3 → `finalScore = 1000 - (attempts × 100)`
     - Else → `finalScore = 500`
4. In the `main` method:
   - Read `type` (1 for ArcadeGame, 2 for PuzzleGame)
   - If `type == 1`:
     - Read `base` and `level`
     - Create `ArcadeGame` object
   - Else:
     - Read `attempts`
     - Create `PuzzleGame` object
   - Call `finalScore()` and print the result.
5. End the program.

## SOURCE CODE:

import java.util.*;
abstract class GameScore{
    abstract int finalScore();
}
class ArcadeGame extends GameScore{
    int base,level;
    ArcadeGame (int base, int level){
        this.base=base;
        this.level=level;
    }
    int finalScore(){
        return base+level*100;
    }
}
class PuzzleGame extends GameScore{
    int attempts;
    PuzzleGame(int attempts){
        this.attempts=attempts;
    }
    int finalScore(){
        return attempts <=3?1000 - attempts * 100 : 500;
    }
}
public class prog{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int type = sc.nextInt();
        GameScore score;
        if(type == 1){
            score = new ArcadeGame(sc.nextInt(),sc.nextInt());
        }
        else{
            score = new PuzzleGame(sc.nextInt());
        }
        System.out.println(score.finalScore());
    }
}
```

## RESULT:
The program successfully calculates and displays the final score based on game type and user input using abstract methods and dynamic method dispatch.
